# NOTE

This plugin is unmaintained, since I'm not using vim-bookmarks anymore. It's possible that things will not work anymore with recent versions of telescope and/or vim-bookmarks.
If somebody wants to take over as a maintainer, let me know.

## Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager and add

```lua
require('telescope').load_extension('vim_bookmarks')
```

somewhere after loading telescope.

## Usage

The extension provides two new pickers:

``` viml
" Pick from all bookmarks
:Telescope vim_bookmarks all
" Only pick from bookmarks in current file
:Telescope vim_bookmarks current_file
```

Lua equivalent:

``` lua
require('telescope').extensions.vim_bookmarks.all()
require('telescope').extensions.vim_bookmarks.current_file()
```

## Customization

Both pickers take a table of options that you can use to customize them. 
Here's a list of available options along with their default values:

| Option            | Explanation                                                         | Default Value                            |
| ---               | ---                                                                 | ---                                      |
| `hide_filename`   | Whether to display the filename of bookmarks in the picker          | true for `all`, false for `current_file` |
| `tail_path`       | If true, display only the filename, otherwise display the full path | Same as your global telescope config     |
| `shorten_path`    | Whether to shorten the file path, works the same as with telescope's builtin pickers. (Only has an effect when `tail_path=false`)  | true                                     |
| `prompt_title`    | Title of the search prompt                                          | 'vim-bookmarks'                          |
| `width_line`      | Width reserved for the line number in the picker                    | 5                                        |
| `width_text`      | Width reserved for the bookmark text in the picker                  | 60                                       |
| `width_annotation`| Width reserved for the bookmark annotation in the picker            | 20                                       |
| `only_annotated`  | Only display bookmarks that have an annotation                      | false                                    |
| `attach_mappings` | See following section                                               | {}                                       |

Additionally, the table of options is passed on to your configured `qflist_previewer` and `generic_sorter` (See Telescope docs for details)

You can configure this extension via standard telescope extension mechanism

```lua
require('telescope').setup {
  ...
  extensions = {
    ...
    vim_bookmarks = {
      width_text = 60,
      width_annotation = 20,
    }
  }
}
```

## Actions

The extension also provides custom actions for managing bookmarks:

| Action                         | Explanation 
| ---                            | ---         
| `delete_at_cursor`             | Deletes the bookmark at current cursor position
| `delete_selected`              | Deletes all bookmarks selected via Telescope's multi-selection
| `delete_selected_or_at_cursor` | If there's a multi selection, delete those bookmarks, otherwise delete the one at the curso position
| `delete_all`                   | Deletes all bookmarks (Same as `:BookmarkClearAll`)

For example:

```lua
local bookmark_actions = require('telescope').extensions.vim_bookmarks.actions
require('telescope').extensions.vim_bookmarks.all {
    attach_mappings = function(_, map) 
        map('n', 'dd', bookmark_actions.delete_selected_or_at_cursor)

        return true
    end
}
```
